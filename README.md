#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications.
Software engineering serves great importance in technology, these include:
1. Innovation - it drives innovation by enabling the creation of new applications and technologies that improve our daily lives.
2. Efficiency - it helps businesses automate processes, increasing efficiency and productivity.
3. Security - through software engineering, security measures have been put in place to protect data and systems from cyber threats.
4. Collaboration - it enhances collaboration among teams by defining clear processes, making it easier for teams to work together.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Software engineering has gone milestones that have shaped how software is built and maintained today. The first major milestone was the introduction of structured programming in the 1960s and 1970s, which helped developers organize code into smaller, manageable parts. This improved the readability and reliability of code, making it easier to work on complex projects.
In the 1980s, object-oriented programming (OOP) became popular, changing the way software was designed by organizing it around objects that represent both data and actions. This made code more modular and reusable, allowing for better management of complex projects.
The most recent milestone is the rise of Agile methodologies in 2001. Agile introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development, focusing on quick releases and continuous feedback. This has become the standard way of working, helping teams to adapt to changes and deliver software more efficiently.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Planning - this is when the project's goals, scope, and feasibility are defined. It involves gathering requirements, setting timelines, estimating costs, and assembling the development team.
2. Designing - this phase involves creating the architecture of the software, which includes defining the overall system structure, user interfaces, databases, and other components.
3. Coding -  developers write the code based on the design specifications.
4. Testing - once the software is developed, it undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
5. Deployment - after successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment where it becomes available to users.
6. Maintaining - the maintenance phase involves ongoing support, updates, and improvements to the software after it has been deployed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall and Agile are two different ways to manage software development. Waterfall is a step-by-step method where each phase, like planning, designing, and building, must be finished before moving on to the next. Itâ€™s strict and works best for projects with clear, unchanging goals, like government or safety-related software.
Agile, on the other hand, is flexible and allows teams to work in short cycles, making changes as they go based on feedback. This method is great for projects where things might change along the way, like developing a new app or website. Agile is more adaptable and better for fast-paced projects.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A Software Developer writes and maintains the code that makes up the software, turning design ideas into functional features. They also document their work to make it easier for others to understand and maintain the code in the future.
A Quality Assurance Engineer tests the software to make sure it works as expected and is free of bugs. They identify issues and report them to the developers for fixing, ensuring that the final product meets quality standards.
A Project Manager oversees the entire project, making sure it stays on schedule and within budget. They coordinate the team's efforts, communicate with stakeholders, and manage risks to keep the project on track.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are tools for software development as they provide a comprehensive workspace for writing, testing, and debugging code. One example of IDE is Visual Studio Code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) track different versions of the code, making it easy to see what has changed, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with others. One example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Managing complex code is a common challenge and can be overcome by writing modular code and using consistent coding practices.
2. Finding and fixing bugs is often time-consuming and can be overcome by using automated testing and debugging tools to streamline the process.
3. Adapting to frequent requirement changes can be changing and can be overcome by applying Agile methodologies and maintaining regular communication with stakeholders.
4. Meeting tight deadlines can be stressful and can be overcome by planning thoroughly, prioritizing tasks, and monitoring progress to stay on track.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit Testing checks individual components or functions of the code for correctness. It's crucial for catching issues early in development and ensuring each part works as expected.
2. Integration testing verifies that different components of the software work together correctly. It helps identify issues in the interactions between components.
3. System Testing evaluates the complete and integrated software to ensure it meets the specified requirements. It's important for validating the overall functionality and performance of the entire system.
4. Acceptance Testing determines if the software meets the user's needs and requirements. It's essential for ensuring the software is ready for release and will satisfy the end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering involves crafting and refining inputs or "prompts" to effectively communicate with AI models in order to achieve desired outputs.
Importance: Well-designed prompts can improve the quality and relevance of the AI's responses, making it easier to get useful information and solve problems efficiently.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: What is the weather today?
Improved prompt: Provide me the details of the weather today in Nairobi using simple to understand English decorating the answer with appropriate emojis.
